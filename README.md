# Free-Code-Camp-Theme
A new theme to make free code camp a bit nicer

Do you know how FCC is a bit ugly? You feel like it has a great deal of potential but you just can't go beyond the fact that that horrible green is screaming at you and at the same time, everything is freakishly white?! Well, I'm offering you a change!

What Changes With the Free Code Camp Theme (Or At Least, This One?)

* That horrible green is a smooth green bluish color;
* That weird huge gonna-eat-your-face navbar is smaller and friendlier
* New smooth scrollbar on the instructions collumn.

Here's a preview:

## How to install
Install the Google Chrome extension [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en "Stylish on Chrome Store"), create a new style and copy the code onto it. 
Apply it to every URL that starts with <https://www.freecodecamp.com/>. 

## Bugs
Well I couln't do anything about:

* The streak's colors :(, javascript is overwritting pretty hard


## Future Additions

Gonna add to this folder the code in sass, so you can pick whatever color you want, instead of that original darkgreen monster!
Until then you can always just "replace all" #009866.


Feel free to fork it, play with it, and make it better!
Thank you for your time and keep on hacking (stole [Travis Neilson](https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners "Travis Nielson Youtube Channel") quote)
